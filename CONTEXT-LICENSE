# AI Context License

## Scope

This license applies to all files in the following directories and files:

- `.agents/` — AI agent context (YAML, JSON)
- `.users/` — Human documentation (Markdown)
- `AGENTS.md` — AI agent entry point

## License

These files are licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA 4.0)**.

## What This Means for Forks

### You CAN:
- Fork and modify the context files
- Add your own context documents
- Translate into other languages
- Use commercially

### You MUST:
- **Attribution** — Credit "Nextain" (https://github.com/nextain) as the original author
- **ShareAlike** — Distribute your modified context files under the same CC-BY-SA 4.0 license
- **Preserve the license** — Keep this CONTEXT-LICENSE file (or equivalent) in your fork

### What This Protects:

The CC-BY-SA 4.0 license ensures that the following principles propagate through all forks:

1. **Open Source Contribution Structure** — The dual-directory architecture (`.agents/` for AI, `.users/` for humans) and the mirroring rules that keep them in sync
2. **AI Agent Collaboration Principles** — How AI agents should read, understand, and contribute to the project (defined in `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/context/contributing.yaml`)
3. **Community Attribution Chain** — Every fork must credit upstream, creating a traceable chain of attribution back to the original project

### Why This Matters:

In the age of vibe coding, AI context files are a new kind of open source infrastructure. They define how AI agents interact with a project — the rules, the philosophy, the contribution guidelines. If these can be taken and relicensed under proprietary terms, the upstream community loses its voice in how the project evolves.

CC-BY-SA 4.0 prevents this. Any fork must share its context improvements under the same terms, ensuring the entire ecosystem benefits.
