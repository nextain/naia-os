# Context reading order for new contributors
onboarding:
  required_reads:
    - path: ".agents/context/agents-rules.json"
      purpose: "Project rules (SoT)"
    - path: ".agents/context/project-index.yaml"
      purpose: "Context index + mirroring rules"
    - path: ".agents/context/philosophy.yaml"
      purpose: "Core philosophy"
  submodule_rule: "When working in a submodule, read its rulesEntrypoint first"

# Code contribution rules
code:
  process: "PLAN → CHECK → BUILD (TDD) → VERIFY → CLEAN → COMMIT"
  workflow_ref: ".agents/workflows/development-cycle.yaml"
  rules:
    - "TDD: write test first (RED) → minimal code (GREEN) → refactor"
    - "VERIFY: actually run the app — type-check alone is insufficient"
    - "No console.log/warn/error — use structured Logger only"
    - "Follow Biome for linting and formatting"
    - "Integration tests first, then unit tests if needed"
    - "Minimal change principle — only modify what's needed"

# Context contribution rules
context:
  license: "CC-BY-SA-4.0"
  rules:
    - "All .agents/ YAML files must have SPDX header"
    - "All .agents/ JSON files must have _license field"
    - "All .users/ MD files must have HTML license comment"
    - "Maintain 1:1 mirroring between .agents/ and .users/"
    - "SoT lives in .agents/ — .users/ is the human-readable mirror"
  cascade:
    description: "When modifying context, propagate changes"
    order: ["self", "parent", "siblings", "children", "mirror"]
    ref: "agents-rules.json cascadeRules section"

# Philosophy compliance
philosophy:
  ref: ".agents/context/philosophy.yaml"
  must_preserve:
    - "AI sovereignty — no vendor lock-in"
    - "Privacy first — local execution default"
    - "Transparency — open source, no hidden behavior"
  may_extend:
    - "Add new principles that don't conflict"
    - "Add new skills, workflows, integrations"

# Skill contribution
skills:
  format: "OpenClaw skill.json spec"
  location: "agent/assets/default-skills/"
  rules:
    - "Each skill needs skill.json with proper metadata"
    - "Follow existing skill naming: naia-{name}/"
    - "Test with actual LLM calls, not mocks"

# PR guidelines
pull_requests:
  title_format: "type(scope): description"
  types: ["feat", "fix", "refactor", "docs", "chore", "test"]
  checklist:
    - "Tests pass (npm test / pytest)"
    - "VERIFY step completed (app actually runs)"
    - "Context files updated if architecture changed"
    - "No console.log/warn/error left in code"
    - "Work log entry if significant change"
