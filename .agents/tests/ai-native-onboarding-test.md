# AI-Native Onboarding & Contribution Test Scenarios

These scenarios verify that AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Cline, etc.) correctly understand the project and guide contributors when reading `.agents/` context.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repo fresh (or open a new AI session in this repo)
2. Copy each scenario prompt and paste it into your AI coding agent
3. Compare the response against the expected behavior
4. Check each item in the verification checklist at the bottom

## Test 1: First Contact — "What is this project?"

**Prompt:**
> What is this project and how can I help?

**Expected:**
- Agent explains Naia OS (AI OS based on Bazzite, avatar-centric)

- Agent mentions that any language is welcome
- Agent does NOT ask the contributor to read lengthy documentation first

---

## Test 2: Contribution Types — Know All 10

**Prompt:**

- Agent mentions that context contributions are valued equally to code
- Agent mentions appropriate issue templates for each type

---

## Test 3: Beginner Guidance

**Prompt:**
> I'm a beginner developer. I've never contributed to open source before. What should I do?

**Expected:**
- Agent recommends low-difficulty contributions (Translation, Bug Report, Testing, Documentation)
- Agent explains the onboarding steps (clone → open with AI → ask)
- Agent does NOT overwhelm with architecture details
- Agent is encouraging and welcoming

---

## Test 4: Translation Contribution Flow

**Prompt:**
> I want to translate the project docs to Japanese. How do I do this?

**Expected:**
- Agent explains: create `.users/context/ja/` directory
- Agent mentions the English originals are in `.users/context/`
- Agent mentions opening a `translation.yml` issue template
- Agent mentions CI will check structural sync with English
- Agent mentions SPDX license headers are required

---

## Test 5: Code Contribution Flow

**Prompt:**
> I want to fix a bug. What's the process?

**Expected:**
- Agent describes: pick issue → create branch (`issue-{N}-{desc}`) → code → self-review → PR
- Agent mentions TDD (test first)
- Agent mentions the PR checklist (tests pass, app runs, context updated)
- Agent mentions AI attribution (`Assisted-by` trailer)
- Agent mentions commit messages must be in English

---

## Test 6: AI Attribution Awareness

**Prompt:**
> Do I need to disclose that I'm using an AI tool?

**Expected:**
- Agent confirms: yes, AI disclosure is required
- Agent explains: use `Assisted-by: {tool}` git trailer
- Agent explains: check the AI disclosure box in the PR template
- Agent clarifies: this is enforced but not blocking (educational, not punitive)
- Agent affirms: AI usage is welcomed, transparency is the requirement

---

## Test 7: Context Contribution Understanding

**Prompt:**
> I think the architecture documentation is outdated. Can I update it?

**Expected:**
- Agent confirms: yes, context contributions are welcome and valued equally to code
- Agent explains the triple-mirror sync: `.agents/` → `.users/context/` → `.users/context/ko/`
- Agent mentions SPDX license headers (CC-BY-SA-4.0)
- Agent mentions using the `context_contribution.yml` issue template
- Agent warns about cascade rules (changes propagate)

---

## Test 8: Security Report Handling

**Prompt:**
> I found a security vulnerability in the agent. Should I open an issue?

**Expected:**
- Agent says: do NOT open a public issue
- Agent directs to GitHub Security Advisory (private vulnerability reporting)
- Agent explains this is for responsible disclosure

---

## Test 9: Language Barrier Test

**Prompt (in Japanese):**
> このプロジェクトに貢献したいのですが、英語が苦手です。日本語で参加できますか？

**Expected:**
- Agent responds in Japanese (or the contributor's language)
- Agent confirms: any language is welcome
- Agent explains: Git records (code, commits) should be English, but AI translates
- Agent explains: issues and PR descriptions can be in native language
- Agent reassures: language should not be a barrier

---

## Test 10: Skill Contribution Flow

**Prompt:**
> I want to create a new AI skill that checks the weather. How?

**Expected:**
- Agent explains skill location: `agent/assets/default-skills/`
- Agent mentions OpenClaw `skill.json` spec
- Agent mentions naming convention: `naia-{name}/`
- Agent mentions using the `skill_proposal.yml` issue template
- Agent mentions testing with actual LLM calls, not mocks

---

## Test 11: PR Template Awareness

**Prompt:**
> I'm about to submit a PR. What should I include?

**Expected:**
- Agent describes the PR template sections:
  - What changed (with issue reference)
  - Type of change (checkbox)
  - AI disclosure (checkbox)
  - Checklist (tests, verify, context, license, English commits)
- Agent mentions title format: `type(scope): description`
- Agent mentions keeping PRs small and focused (under 20 files)

---

## Test 12: Quality Strategy Understanding

**Prompt:**
> How does this project handle quality control for contributions?

**Expected:**
- Agent describes the layered quality strategy:
  - L1: Context (`.agents/` ensures AI understands the project)
  - L2: Automation (CI gates)
  - L3: AI Review (PR Agent, Phase 2)
  - L4: Human Judgment (maintainer review)
- Agent mentions that rich context is the primary quality mechanism
- Agent does NOT describe the project as having a "gatekeeping" approach

---

## Scoring

| Score | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 12/12 | Full AI-native onboarding works |
